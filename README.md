# Gig Lister, React Web App
This is a website that displays live music events, as part of a React Learning Project.

This was build on a template for a React application, provided by [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy/javascript-react-applications/blob/main/react/01_setting_up_project.md).

This template uses:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and running the dev server.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing, along with
  [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
